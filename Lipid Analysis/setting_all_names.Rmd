# Data Prep

## Libraries

```{r}
## Install the following packages 
library(stringr)
library(data.table)
```

## Insert Interested Outcomes

```{r}
outcomes <- c("SBP_total","DBP_total","Insulin","Chol_T","TG","LDL","HDL","CRP","ApoB")
```

## Reading in Data
Read in Targeted File as "food"
```{r}
# Metabolite Identifiers (Mass, Retention, Compound)
food <- as.data.frame(fread("./Lipid pos unique to Salmon 100% of files - found in plasma_QUANT.txt",sep = "\t", header = T))
food <- as.data.frame(t(food))
food <- cbind(rownames(food),food)
colnames(food) <- food["Compound",]
food <- food[-1,]
rownames(food) <- NULL
colnames(food)[1] <- "StudyID"

metabolites <- colnames(food)[2:length(food)] # identify metabolite names

# Create a new dataframe with information about metabolites
met_info <- t(food[!grepl("raw", food$StudyID),])
rownames(met_info) <- NULL
colnames(met_info) <- met_info[1,]
met_info <- met_info[-1,]
met_info <- as.data.frame(met_info[,c("Compound Name","CASNumber", "Number Passed", "Retention Time", "Measured Retention Time",
                                      "Product Mass","QualifierMass")])
```

Removing Unwanted Rows(Rows Not Containing "raw" in Their Names)
```{r}
food <- food[grepl("raw", food$StudyID),]
```

## Read Supplementary Files
reading in "info_file", "batch_file", "complete_health_outcome". Info File Contains Following Info: "Period", "Trial", "Time", "Age", and "Sex"
```{r}
Info_file <- read.csv("./S44data_MASTER_41 subjects.csv",as.is = T)
Info_file <- Info_file[,c("StudyID", "Period", "Trial", "Time","Age", "Sex", "Diet")] 
Info_file <- Info_file[complete.cases(Info_file),] # Removing rows with incomplete data
```

### Batch File
Contains Following Info: "batch", "order"
```{r}
batch_file <- read.csv("./compound_values_raw_height.csv",as.is = T) 
batch_file <- batch_file[, c("id.basic", "batch", "order")]  
batch_file <- batch_file[complete.cases(batch_file),]
```

### Health Outcome
```{r}
complete_health_outcome <- read.csv("./S44data_MASTER_41 subjects.csv")
```

#### Only Reading "outcomes" of Health File
```{r}
complete_health_outcome <- complete_health_outcome[,c("StudyID", "Period", "Trial", outcomes)]

## replacing "." with NA
complete_health_outcome[complete_health_outcome=="."] <- NA
```

## Setting Up a Common ID
Each File has different names and a common names is needed
```{r}
Info_file[1:5,1]
batch_file[1:5,1]
food[30:35,1]
```

### Info_file
```{r}
Info_file$StudyID <- gsub("S44-","", Info_file$StudyID, fixed = TRUE)
Info_file$StudyID <- paste(Info_file$StudyID, Info_file$Time, Info_file$Trial, sep = " ")
Info_file$StudyID <- gsub("p","P",Info_file$StudyID)
```

### Batch_file
```{r}
batch_file$id.basic <- gsub("Day.[0-9]_","",batch_file$id.basic)
batch_file$id.basic <- gsub("_area2height.raw.","",batch_file$id.basic)
batch_file$id.basic <- gsub("\\."," ",batch_file$id.basic)
batch_file$id.basic <- gsub("S44 ","",batch_file$id.basic)
batch_file$id.basic <- gsub("  P*"," P", batch_file$id.basic)

names(batch_file)[names(batch_file)=="id.basic"] <- "StudyID" 
```

### food
```{r}
food$day_numb <- ifelse(str_detect(food$StudyID,"Instrument"), str_extract(food$StudyID,"[0-9]+"),NA)

food$StudyID <- gsub(".*Instrument", "Instrument", food$StudyID)
food$StudyID <- gsub(".*_S44-", "", food$StudyID)
food$StudyID <- gsub("(raw)", "", food$StudyID, fixed = T)
food$StudyID <- gsub("-", " ", food$StudyID, fixed = T)
food$StudyID <- gsub("  P*"," P", food$StudyID)
```

Checking Results
```{r}
Info_file$StudyID[1:5]
batch_file$StudyID[1:5]
food[30:35,1]
```

### Merging "food","Info_file","batch_file"
```{r}
new_merged <- merge(batch_file,Info_file, by="StudyID",all=T)
new_merged <- merge(new_merged,food, by="StudyID",all=T)

## remove incorrect duplicated QC values
QC_ID <- new_merged[grepl("Instrument",new_merged$StudyID),]
QC_ID <- QC_ID[QC_ID$batch==QC_ID$day_numb,]  
new_merged <- new_merged[is.na(new_merged$day_numb),]
new_merged <- rbind(new_merged,QC_ID)

new_merged$day_numb <- NULL
```

### Adding two Health Outcomes of "HDL/LDL", and "Chol_T/HDL"
```{r}
complete_health_outcome$HDL_LDL <- complete_health_outcome$HDL/complete_health_outcome$LDL

complete_health_outcome$Chol_T_HDL <- complete_health_outcome$Chol_T/complete_health_outcome$HDL
```

### Creating "health_outcome", which is the Difference in Outcomes within Each Trial
```{r}
outcomes <- c("SBP_total","DBP_total","Insulin","Chol_T","TG","LDL","HDL","CRP","ApoB","HDL_LDL","Chol_T_HDL")

complete_health_outcome[,outcomes] <- apply(complete_health_outcome[,outcomes],2,function(x) as.numeric(as.character(x)))

complete_health_outcome$StudyID <- gsub(".*-","",complete_health_outcome$StudyID)

names_health <- as.character(unique(complete_health_outcome$StudyID))
tmp.health <- diff_health <- tmp.health.dat <- c()

for(j in names_health){
  tmp.health <- complete_health_outcome[complete_health_outcome$StudyID==j,]
  
  for(k in 1:2){
    if(sum(tmp.health$Trial == k) == 2){
      tmp.health.dat <- tmp.health[tmp.health$Trial == k,] 
      
      tmp.health.dat <- (tmp.health.dat[grepl(max(tmp.health.dat$Period),tmp.health.dat$Period),outcomes])-
        (tmp.health.dat[grepl(min(tmp.health.dat$Period),tmp.health.dat$Period),outcomes])

      tmp.health.dat <- cbind(StudyID=j, Trial=k, tmp.health.dat)
      
      diff_health <- rbind(diff_health, tmp.health.dat)
    }
  }
}
```

# Writting Out Results
```{r}
write.table(new_merged,
            file="./merged_file.txt",row.names=F)
write.table(diff_health,
            file="./health_outcome.txt",row.names=F)
write.table(complete_health_outcome,
            file="./complete_health_outcome.txt",
            row.names = F)
write.table(met_info,
            file="./met_info.txt",
            row.names = F)
```
